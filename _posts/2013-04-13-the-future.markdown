<p>In February I left Buffer after working on every aspect of the app for over a year and a half (and documenting a lot of the interesting bits here along the way!). I&#8217;m immensely proud of everything that we achieved in that time, growing the service to half a million users and the company to 10 awesome team members whilst travelling! Buffer isn&#8217;t going away any time soon and I&#8217;m sure the companies future is very bright with Joel and Leo steering the ship - I can&#8217;t wait to see what they have in store.</p>

<p>So what now? I&#8217;m excited to say that I&#8217;m now building a new company to tackle the problems with remote working and distributed teams with a couple of awesome guys, <a href="https://twitter.com/mattboyd">Matt</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ericbieller">Eric</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a problem I&#8217;ve been thinking about ever since I stopped working in an office environment - how can you bring back the fun, spontaneity, and speed of communication of an office into the online world? It is a huge challenge, both technically and socially - weâ€™re tackling the problem in a unique way and think we have a <a href="https://www.sqwiggle.com">pretty great solution brewing</a>&#8230;</p>

<p>If you have any thoughts on distributed teams then please go ahead and leave them in the comments, <strong>I&#8217;d love to hear any experiences or problems that you might be facing.</strong></p>
