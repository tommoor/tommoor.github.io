Writing is always the first thing that gives, whether we’re having a bumper month or a ton of trouble with our architecture and product - it seems as though there is always an excuse not to write about it...

This was definitely the case last year, where I published a grand total of _zero_ posts. I write as much for ‘future me’ as anyone else and I don’t want to look back on 2014 in a decades time and ask myself - “wait, what the hell happened that year?!”. In fact, a lot went on...


## Sqwiggle
This deserves (and will get) a post or two for itself, needless to say it was a year far from smooth sailing and chock full of events. 

I feel as though we experienced the entire startup lifecycle several times over from the post-raising hiring spree, a traction plateau and a trip through the infamous ‘valley of death’... much more to come on this.


## Personal
On a personal level, 2014 was my most travelled year so far, and almost none of it planned more than a month in advance. It's fantastic having our company set up in a way that makes this possible...

- January - Starting the year with a week in **New York**
- February - **Lake Tahoe** for our first [company retreat](http://blog.sqwiggle.com/lessons-learned-first-company-retreat/)
- March - My first SXSW experience in Austin, **Texas**
- April - Two weeks in **Berlin** checking out the scene
- May - Back to **England** for two weeks sorting out visa
- June - Moved back to **San Francisco**
- September - Two weeks in **[Beijing](https://medium.com/@kinwong/introducing-the-china-trek-for-founders-6a5f13ea2d3)** and **Hong Kong**
- November - Exploring **Los Angeles** for a quick break
- December - A long weekend in **Seoul** for a speaking slot and christmas in **England**

At the beginning of summer I finally regained my H1B visa and moved back to San Francisco on a more permanent basis, found a room, bought some furniture and a [bike](http://instagram.com/p/rDO9jDpHUY).

It’s nice to have somewhere to call home for the first time in 3 years.
