Writing is always the first thing that gives, whether we’re having a bumper month or a ton of trouble with our architecture and product - it seems as though there is always an excuse not to write about it...

This was definitely the case last year, where I published a grand total of _zero_ posts. I write as much for ‘future me’ as anyone else and I don’t want to look back on 2014 in a decades time and ask myself - “wait, what the hell happened that year?!”. In fact, a lot went on...


## Sqwiggle
This deserves (and will get) a whole post to itself, needless to say it was a year far from smooth sailing and I feel as though we experienced the entire startup lifecycle several times over including a trip through the infamous ‘valley of death’... much more to come.


## Personal
On a personal level, 2014 was my most travelled year so far, and almost none of it planned more than a month in advance. It's fantastic having our company set up in a way that makes this possible...

January - Starting the year with a week in **New York**
February - **Lake Tahoe** for our first company retreat
March - My first SXSW in Austin, **Texas**
April - Two weeks in **Berlin** checking out the scene
May - Back to **England** for two weeks sorting out visa
June - Moved back to **San Francisco**
September - Two weeks in **Beijing** and **Hong Kong**
November - Exploring **Los Angeles** for a quick break
December - A long weekend in **Seoul** for a speaking slot and christmas in **England**

At the beginning of summer I finally regained my H1B visa and moved back to San Francisco on a more permanent basis, found a room, bought some furniture and a bike.

It’s nice to have somewhere to call home for the first time in 3 years.
